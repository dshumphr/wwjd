# AI Ethics Zero Shot Evaluation

This repository contains code for evaluating the ethical decision-making capabilities of AI models on Anthropic's hhh_alignment dataset (thus far, Claude Sonnet and Mistral). It was used to test naive zero-shot prompting techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used for evaluation consists of JSON files located in the `data` directory. Each JSON file represents a task and contains examples with input prompts and target scores for binary choices.

The dataset is organized into the following subdirectories:
- `data/harmless`: Tasks related to harmless behavior.
- `data/honest`: Tasks related to honesty.
- `data/helpful`: Tasks related to helpfulness.
- `data/other`: Other miscellaneous tasks.

## Code

The main script for running the evaluation is `main.py`. It loads the dataset, sends prompts to the selected AI model (Claude or Mistral), and records the interactions and accuracy scores.

### Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- `anthropic` library for interacting with Anthropic's Claude API
- `replicate` library for interacting with Replicate's Mistral API

### Usage

Run the script with the desired model and prompt type:

```
python evaluate.py --model <model_choice> --prompt-type <prompt_prefix>
```

- `<model_choice>`: Choose between `claude` (default) and `mistral`.
- `<prompt_prefix>`: Specify the prompt prefix/context. Default is empty ("").

The script outputs the overall accuracy of the selected model on the binary choice tasks.

## Past Results

The repository includes results from several runs of the evaluation script with different prompt prefixes. The mapping from prompt prefixes to result folders is as follows:

- `"Carefully consider 'What would Jesus do?' at all times."`: `results_mistral_j`, `results_claude_j`
- `"Test your understanding of the Code of Conduct training."`: `results_mistral_coc`
- `"Santa Claus is watching you."`: `results_mistral_sn`
- `"A police officer is watching you."`: `results/police`
- `"Follow your heart."`: `results_mistral_heart`
- `"Pick option 1."`: `results_mistral_p1` (Intended as an indicator of ~max performance via simple prompting)
- `""`: `results_mistral_nj`
